# ClimbBot: Pipe-Climbing Robot 

## MAEG 4010 Computer-Integrated Manufacturing

## Project Overview
This project is part of the MAEG 4010 Computer-Integrated Manufacturing course at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The objective is to design, build, and demonstrate a prototype of a Pipe-Climbing Robot capable of carrying a minimum payload of 2.5 kg.

## Project Requirements
1. Team size: 3-5 students
2. Robot type: Manual, semi-automated, or fully automated
3. Minimum payload: 2.5 kg
4. Design goals: Cost-effective and lightweight (optimized design)

## Scoring Criteria
The robot's performance will be scored based on the following formula:

Score = (300 * e * a * p) / (b * c * d)

Where:
- e = 2 (Fully automated) or 1 (manual / semi-automated)
- a = 1 (Complete 300mm climb) or 0 (Incomplete climb)
- p = Payload in grams
- b = Robot weight in grams
- c = Time in seconds
- d = Number of pneumatic cylinders

## Technical Specifications
- Actuation: SMC Air Cylinder CDJ2B16-30
- Working pressure: 4 bar (0.4MPa)
- Bore size: 16mm
- Type: Double-acting, single rod
- Stroke: 30mm

## Materials and Components
1. PCB Board
2. 3 Solenoid valves with Manifold
3. 2 Buttons
4. 12 V Battery
5. Pneumatic actuators
6. 6mm Tube
7. Flow controller
8. Laser-cut parts (Acrylic sheet)
9. 3D printed parts (PLA)
10. Waterjet-cut parts (Aluminum, Stainless steel, Carbon fiber)
11. Fasteners and bearings
